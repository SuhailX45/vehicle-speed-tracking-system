~Vehicle Speed Detection System using Python 
This project detects multiple vehicles from a video feed and estimates their speeds in real-time using object tracking and motion analysis. It uses OpenCV, dlib, and Haar Cascade Classifiers to track moving cars, calculate speed, and overlay results directly on the video frame.

~Project Structure

~Vehicle-Speed-Detection/-
README.md ,        -- Project documentation
cars.mp4 ,           --Input video file
outpy.avi  ,         --Output video with speed overlay (auto-generated)
myhaar.xml ,         --Haar cascade classifier for vehicle detection
speed_detection.py  --Main Python script

~Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (Image processing, object detection)
dlib (Object tracking)
Haar Cascade Classifier (Vehicle detection)
Math & Time Modules (Speed estimation)

~Features
Detects multiple moving vehicles in a video
Tracks each vehicle using dlib correlation tracker
Estimates vehicle speed using pixel displacement and calibrated PPM (pixels per meter)
Displays speed in real-time on each vehicle
Saves processed video with bounding boxes and speed overlay

~How Speed is Calculated
Car is detected using Haar Cascade (myhaar.xml)
Tracked using dlib's correlation tracker
Displacement is calculated between two positions

Speed formula used:

bash
Copy
Edit
speed (km/h) = (distance_moved_in_pixels / pixels_per_meter) × fps × 3.6
~How to Run
Make sure Python 3.x is installed

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python dlib
Place your input video (cars.mp4) and Haar XML file (myhaar.xml) in the same directory

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python speed_detection.py
Press ESC to stop the video

~Output

The script will generate a file named outpy.avi with bounding boxes and vehicle speed annotations
Real-time display of each car’s speed in km/h

~Use Cases

Traffic monitoring
Vehicle speed detection for surveillance
Smart city traffic systems
Real-time transport analytics
